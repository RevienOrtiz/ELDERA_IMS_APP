/**
 * ELDERA HEALTH APP - IMS API INTEGRATION OVERVIEW
 * 
 * This Flutter mobile application integrates with the IMS (Information Management System)
 * to provide health services for senior citizens in the Philippines.
 * 
 * BACKEND DEVELOPER: Please refer to the following files for complete API documentation:
 * 
 * 1. IMS_API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md - Complete API documentation and implementation guide
 * 2. lib/services/auth_service.dart - Authentication endpoints and user login flow
 * 3. lib/services/user_service.dart - User profile management endpoints
 * 4. lib/services/announcement_service.dart - Health announcements and notifications
 * 
 * KEY INTEGRATION POINTS:
 * - Base URL: https://ims-api.eldera.gov.ph/api
 * - Authentication: POST /api/auth/login, POST /api/auth/logout
 * - User Management: GET/PUT /api/users/{id}
 * - Announcements: GET /api/announcements (with filtering support)
 * 
 * SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
 * - HTTPS only communication
 * - Proper password hashing (bcrypt recommended)
 * - Input validation and sanitization
 * - Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
 * 
 * The mobile app handles offline functionality with local storage fallbacks,
 * but requires reliable API connectivity for real-time data synchronization.
